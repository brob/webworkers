## Meeting Notes
[George Spake](https://georgespake.com/) will be presenting about [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

ESLint is  a configurable linting tool for JavaScript. 
Using a create-react-app project as an example, we’ll walk through how to add eslint to your project and extend it with [Airbnb’s js style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) and [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier). Finally, we'll squash linting errors by fixing our code and tweaking our eslint config.
