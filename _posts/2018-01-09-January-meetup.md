## Meeting Notes

Bryce Sharp will explain the front-end of his personal passion project, Graph And More Engine. G.A.M.E. is a board games in browser engine, that uses graphs to represent game state. G.A.M.E. uses [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/
) to render JSONs as SVG components. The JSONs are dynamically loaded in real-time using [Socket.io](https://socket.io/). This talk will cover the current state of G.A.M.E. with an emphasis on Vue.js components, with animations, and real-time data transfer using Socket.io.
