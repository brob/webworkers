## Meeting Notes

Bryan Robinson will be presenting on hosting your static file websites with the super simple "JAMstack" host Netlify.

Topics covered will be creation, upload, git deployment, form integration and A/B testing with Netlify.

Depending on time and inclination, a demo of NetlifyCMS can also happen.
