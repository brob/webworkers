## Meeting Notes

George Spake will be discussing NPM, Yarn, Babel, and Webpack from scratch.

Since EcmaScript 6 was released in 2015, Babel has become an essential requirement to writing modern JavaScript. With the trend towards Single Page App architecture and the introduction of libraries like React and Vue, "bundling" apps for production has become an important component of app development. Finally, NPM is the glue that holds Node/JS projects together and Yarn is how we interact with NPM. Let's start small and see how each piece works and how they all fit together to create a powerful tool box of JavaScript awesomeness.
